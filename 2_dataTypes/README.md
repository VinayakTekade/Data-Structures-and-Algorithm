# Data Types

## Variable

A variable is a container used to hold data. Each variable should be given a unique name.

## Fundamental Data Types

Data types are declaration of variables. This determines the type and size of data associated with variables

| Data Type | Meaning               | Size (in bytes) |
| --------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| int       | Integer               | 4               |
| float     | Floating Point        | 4               |
| double    | Double Floating Point | 8               |
| char      | Character             | 1               |
| wchar_t   | Wide Character        | 2               |
| bool      | Boolean               | 1               |
| void      | Empty                 | 0               |

## C++ Type Modifiers

Type modifiers are used to modify the fundamental data types.

| Data Types         | Size in bytes | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| signed int         | 4             | used for integers (equivalent to int)                                             |
| unsigned int       | 4             | can only store positive integers                                                  |
| short              | 2             | used for small integers (range -32768 to 32767)                                   |
| long               | at least 4    | used for large integers (equivalent to long int)                                  |
| long long int      | 8             | used for very large integers (equivalent to long long int).                       |
| unsigned long long | 8             | used for very large positive integers or 0 (equivalent to unsigned long long int) |
| long double        | 8             | used for large floating-point numbers                                             |
| signed char        | 1             | used for characters (guaranteed range -127 to 127)                                |
| unsigned char      | 1             | used for characters (range 0 to 255)                                              |
