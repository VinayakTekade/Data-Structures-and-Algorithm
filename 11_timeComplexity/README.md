# Time Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by a program to rum as a funtion of length of the input

## Types of notations

1. O-notation: It is used to denote asymptotic upper bound. For a given function g(n), we denote it by O(g(n)). Pronounced as “big-oh of g of n”. It also known as worst case time complexity as it denotes the upper bound in which algorithm terminates.
2. Ω-notation: It is used to denote asymptotic lower bound. For a given function g(n), we denote it by Ω(g(n)). Pronounced as “big-omega of g of n”. It also known as best case time complexity as it denotes the lower bound in which algorithm terminates.
3. Θ-notation: It is used to denote the average time of a program.

## Space Complexity

Space Complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by a program to rum as a funtion of length of the input. It is directly propertional to the lasrgest memory your program acquires at any instance during run time.

In this section we will calculate time complexity of a few examples programs
